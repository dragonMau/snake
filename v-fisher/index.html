Mine playing technic:
Idk for first prestige, assuming its same as no supporter rod any p level. (Untill p6 (my current)):
Fish with max rod (except heavy)  and max bait and buy upgrades Salesman, better fish and boats.
As biome ocean unclocked, continue same way untill able to buy golden rod and some upgrades on more chests, better chests, artifact specialist. (All that with pet puffer or smth.)
Then with golden rod (take artifact magnet, axolotl) farm till get bait lover and boost booster maxed, keep buying other special upgrades (fish ovens). And keep money for superium rod (or if you have supportet rod, don't keep money), spend money to upgrade more/better chests and artifact specialist, also expiriensed and better fish, salesman.
When boost booster and bait lover maxed, take magic bait and puffer again, and best fish rod (supporter > infinity > superium, bay last two as needed/awaible) and fish with max bait, rod, biome, boats, rods till level 250, if yet bot maxed upgrades bait efficiency, better chests, more chests, max them. 
After that switch back to axolotl, golden rod, artifact magnet and ocean biome (for lower cooldown) and fish till all awaible special shop maxed.
Then switch back to puffer, max rod, magic bait, max biome and complete prestige xp and money requirements.
Then switch to golden/meteor rod axolotl, artifact magnet, and get charms that left, if left.

(Always buy boosts (all three, emerald preferable (even if want play only few minutes)), always prestige as possible, on treasure grinding use worker manipulations if you want)
