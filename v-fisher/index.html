    <p>Mine playing technique:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>For the first prestige, assume it's the same as using no supporter rod at any prestige level (until prestige 6, my current).</li>
        <li>Fish with the max rod (except heavy), max bait, and buy upgrades for Salesman, better fish, and boats.</li>
        <li>As the ocean biome unlocks, continue the same way until able to buy the golden rod and some upgrades on more chests, better chests, and artifact specialist (all with a pet puffer or similar).</li>
        <li>With the golden rod (take artifact magnet and axolotl), farm until you get bait lover and boost booster maxed. Keep buying other special upgrades (fish ovens) and save money for the superium rod (or if you have the supporter rod, don't keep money).</li>
        <li>Spend money to upgrade more/better chests and artifact specialist, also experienced and better fish, salesman.</li>
        <li>When boost booster and bait lover are maxed, take magic bait and puffer again, and use the best fish rod (supporter > infinity > superium; buy the last two as needed/available) and fish with max bait, rod, biome, boats, and rods until level 250. If upgrades bait efficiency, better chests, more chests aren't maxed, max them.</li>
        <li>After that, switch back to axolotl, golden rod, artifact magnet, and the ocean biome (for lower cooldown) and fish until all available special shop items are maxed.</li>
        <li>Then switch back to puffer, max rod, magic bait, max biome, and complete prestige XP and money requirements.</li>
        <li>Finally, switch to golden/meteor rod axolotl, artifact magnet, and get the remaining charms if any.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>Always buy boosts (all three, emerald preferable, even if you want to play only a few minutes). Always prestige as soon as possible. On treasure grinding, use worker manipulations if desired.</p>
